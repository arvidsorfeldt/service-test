  By not providing "Findlibrealsense2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "librealsense2", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "librealsense2"
  with any of the following names:

    librealsense2Config.cmake
    librealsense2-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "librealsense2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "librealsense2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "librealsense2" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
